        <h2>What is <em>salsa de tomate</em>?</h2>
        <p>Salsa de tomate is a staple in Mexican cuisine because it is a very versatile
            ingredient that can be added to practically most dishes that need some spice or
            simply eaten by dipping your corn chip of choice into. Not only does it
            taste much better than store-bought salsa but grilling the ingredients will
            add to the already full-bodied flavor of the salsa
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>7 tomatoes</li>
            <li>4 tomatillos</li>
            <li>10 chiles serranos</li>
            <li>1/4 onion</li>
            <li>2 garlic bulbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grill your veggies</li>
            <p>So, this recipe is fairly straight forward, as grilling the veggies is going 
                to be the main step in making the salsa. Grill the tomatoes until the skin
                starts to get nice and toasted and starts to slide off. Everything else will
                follow a smilar path but just grill them until most sides are nice and charred.
                The charred skin will add a nice smoky flavor to the salsa.
            </p>
            <li>Mash everything together <em>or blend it</em></li>
            <p>This is where a molcajete will come in handy if you have one, otherwise you can use your
                hands or mash everything inside a plastic container using the bottom of a cup. The point will be
                that you'll be mashing everything until you get the consistency of salsa and how much mashing you do
                will depend on how chunky you want the sauce to be. Add salt while mixing. My mom likes to just throw 
                everything together and the blender is usually pretty good about giving the correct consistency.
            </p>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <p>You can enjoy your salsa de tomate as a dip or add it to traditional food to make it taste 
                even better and give it some good spice.
