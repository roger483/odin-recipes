        <h2>What are enchiladas?</h2>
        <p>Enchiladas are a simple but delicious Mexican dish consisting of tortillas stuffed 
            with ingredients like chicken and cheese, rolled up, dipped in a sauce, and then
            deep fried. They are then topped with sour cream and cheese. If you have a
            sensitive stomach, then they may be chorro-inducing.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Yellow corn tortillas</li>
            <li>dried chile de arbol</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>onion</li>
            <li>chihuahua cheese</li>
            <li>sour cream</li>
            <li>queso fresco</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make salsa roja</li>
            <li>Put cheese (and optionally: chicken) on tortilla</li>
            <li>Roll it up</li>
            <li>Dip rolled up tortilla into red salsa, then throw into oiled pan, or the oven
                at 400 degrees for 20 minutes
            </li>
            <p>You don't really want to fry until hard, just until the tortilla is cooked
                and the cheese is fully melted.
