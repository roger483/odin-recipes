        <h2>What are enchiladas?</h2>
        <p>Enchiladas are a simple but delicious Mexican dish consisting of tortillas stuffed 
            with ingredients like chicken and cheese, rolled up, dipped in a sauce, and then
            deep fried. They are then topped with sour cream and cheese. If you have a
            sensitive stomach, then they may be chorro-inducing.
