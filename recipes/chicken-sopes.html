        <h2>What Are Chicken Sopes?</h2>
        <p>Chicken sopes, or "sopes de pollo" in Spanish, are a type of dish that consist of a round, fried
            puck of maiz similar to a tortilla but thicker and smaller in diameter than a tortilla, that is
            usually topped with a protein and a sauce. Common toppings are chicken, beef, and refried beans,
            which are then covered with a guacamole sauce or sour cream (or both! <em>yum!</em>) and finished 
            with cheese, lettuce, radish slices, or onions. The best thing about sopes is that you get to choose the 
            various toppings you want and there's no right way to make them. If served as an appetizer, one or 
            two will suffice but if they are the main dish, four would complete a full dish. Our recipe wil only be using
            a few ingredients but you can add almost any combination of toppings to yours.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the chicken</li>
            <p>You'll want to start with making the chicken by throwing it in an oiled pan. Cook for 25-30 minutes on medium-high.
                When it is done cooking, take it out and shred the chicken, then, put it back in the pan with the onion, tomato, salt, pepper to taste, and a the garlic.
            </p>
            <li>Make the sopes</li>
            <p><em>Optional:</em> you can purchase the sopes pre-made
            from a Mexican supermarket but they are better made from scratch!</p>
            <p>To make the sopes from scratch you will have to procure
                nixtamalized corn flour like Maseca or Torti Masa. Get a large bowl
                and put the corn flour, a bit of regular flour, and a pinch of salt in. Then, begin adding
                a bit of water slowly to the corn flour and mix for a couple of minutes until you get
                a nice texture that doesn't stick to your hands much and should
                resemble play dough.
            </p>
            <p>Next, take bit of dough and roll it into a ball. Then, with
                water-moistened hands, flatten the ball into a patty. Generally, you
                don't want the patty to be too thick or too thin. Keep in mind
                that you'll be biting into the thickness of the sope, plus all of
                the other ingredients stacked on each other. You'll want manageable 
                bites. Slap the patty from one hand to another until you have a nice disk
                with a 4-inch diameter. Add more corn flour as necessary.
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, there are a things you can do to personalize the sopes
                to your liking. You can either cook the dough on a griddle for healthier
                meal, or you can deep-fry the sope for a nice crispy texture. If cooking
                on a griddle, cook each side for about a minute each and if frying, fry the dough until golden 
                brown. Since we don't make them too often in my household, we usually like to deep-fry them.
            </p>
            <li>Make the guac sauce</li>
            <p>Making the guac sauce we use at home is fairly simple. You will need to get two avocados, three tablespoons
                of sour cream, and a can of pickled jalapenos. You'll want to buy the pickled peppers that come
                chopped already, or simply de-vein them and take off the stems. One or two peppers will suffice,
                adjust for preference. Grab all your igredients, plus about a quarter cup
                of the pickled pepper juice, and throw them in a blender until you get a nice creamy
                texture.
            </p>
            <li>Put it all together</li>
            <p>Here's the fun part in making sopes; you can customize them however you like. My preferred way to eat
                them is by putting the chicken on the sope, covering that in guac sauce, then topping it off with 
                some <em>queso fresco</em> but as I mentioned before, you can top them with whatever other Mexican-styled ingredients
                you may like.
            </p>
            <li>Enjoy!!</li>
