        <h2>What Are Chicken Sopes?</h2>
        <p>Chicken sopes, or "sopes de pollo" in Spanish, are a type of dish that consist of a round, fried
            puck of maiz similar to a tortilla but thicker and smaller in diameter than a tortilla, that is
            usually topped with a protein and a sauce. Common toppings are chicken, beef, and refried beans,
            which are then covered with a guacamole sauce or sour cream (or both! <em>yum!</em>) and finished 
            with lettuce, radish slices, or onions. The best thing about sopes is that you get to choose the 
            various toppings you want and there's no right way to make them. If served as an appetizer, one or 
            two will suffice but if they are the main dish, four would complete a full dish.
