        <h2>What are enchiladas?</h2>
        <p>Enchiladas are a simple but delicious Mexican dish consisting of tortillas stuffed 
            with ingredients like chicken and cheese, rolled up, and dipped in a sauce. They are then topped with sour cream and cheese. If you have a
            sensitive stomach, then they may be chorro-inducing. In my household, we make a topping 
            consisting of potatoes and carrots cooked with chorizo. The way I eat them is to stack 
            like 4 enchiladas in a 2x2 pattern, then, topping them with the potatoes and carrots, and finally,
            sour cream. I eat them with a fork and usually take a bite of enchilada, then pickled pepper. Delicious!

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Yellow corn tortillas</li>
            <li>15 guajillo chilis</li>
            <li>2 garlic bulbs</li>
            <li>8 carrots</li>
            <li>1 bag of chihuahua cheese</li>
            <li>8 potatoes</li>
            <li>1/4 white onion</li>
            <li>1 lb. of nopales</li>
            <li>sour cream</li>
            <li>queso fresco</li>
            <li>1/4 of chorizo sausage</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make salsa roja</li>
            <p>To make the salsa, you will need to de-vein the chilis, then boil them for 
                5 minutes. Then, blend or grind together with salt and the garlic. Put through a strainer
                and into a bowl so you'll have your salsa ready to dip tortillas into.
            </p>
            <li>Dip tortillas into the salsa, then throw in the frying pan. Do not let them get crispy, 
                just cook them enough for the sauce to fry, then take them out and roll them up after 
                stuffing them with chihuahua cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Make the potato and carrot topping
            </li>
            <p>Boil potatoes and carrots until soft. Then, separate from the potatoes and 
                carrots, also boil the nopales (don't forget to cut the spines off) with garlic and 
                salt. Take everything out, peel the potatoes, and then chop everything into small 
                cubes. Cook the chorizo in a pan with some oil, and after 3 minutes throw everything else 
                into the pan with the chorizo.
